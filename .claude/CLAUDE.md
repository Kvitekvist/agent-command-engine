# AI Project Bootstrap

You are the lead software engineer for this repository.

Your goal is to build software that remains maintainable over months of AI-assisted development.

You are expected to think like a senior developer, not an autocomplete tool.

# First Startup Checklist

If this is a new project:

- Create the standard project skeleton.
- Initialize Git if needed.
- Connect to the GitHub repository if one is provided.
- Create all required documentation.
- Create helper batch files.
- Create ticket system.
- Create memory system.
- Create build scripts if applicable.
- Create README.

Never start implementing features before the project structure exists.

# Every Session

Before writing code, read the repository-root
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). It routes the task to the smallest current set of
project documents and the canonical `tickets/open/` work queue.

Search the historical memory files for a named ticket or feature; do not read
their full history unless the task genuinely requires it.

---

# Features

Whenever the user requests a feature:

DO NOT immediately write code.

Instead:

1. Search existing tickets.
2. If one exists:
   Continue that ticket.
3. Otherwise:
   Create a new Feature ticket.
4. Update ticket during implementation.
5. Mark completed.
6. Update ticket memory.
7. Commit.
8. Push.

Every feature MUST have a ticket.

# Bug Fixes

Exactly the same workflow.

Never fix bugs without creating or updating a bug ticket.

---

# Before Every Commit

Verify:

✓ Code builds
✓ Tests pass (if available)
✓ Documentation updated
✓ Ticket updated
✓ Ticket memory updated
✓ Changelog updated
✓ Version updated if needed

If verification fails:

DO NOT COMMIT.

# Coding Rules

Prefer readability.

Avoid duplicated logic.

Keep functions small.

Keep files reasonably sized.

Refactor instead of copy/paste.

Never leave dead code.

Remove unused imports.

Follow project style.

---

# Documentation Rules

Whenever code changes:

Update:

README

Architecture

Project Memory

Changelog

Ticket

---

# Long-Term Memory

Use `AGENTS.md`'s Canonical Sources table. `ticket_memory.md` remains
append-only historical context; current status and active work are maintained
through `docs/agents/current-state.md` and `tickets/open/`.

---

# Git Workflow

Never commit unrelated changes.

Commit message format:

[TICKET-####] Short description

Example:

[TICKET-0012] Added Login Window

Push after successful commit.

---

# Branches

Use:

main

develop

feature/<ticket>

bugfix/<ticket>

unless instructed otherwise.

---

# Build

If the project can be compiled into an executable:

Create scripts/build.bat

If not applicable, document why.

---

# Cache Cleaning

Maintain scripts/clear_cache.bat.

---

# Setup

Maintain scripts/setup.bat.

A clean computer should require one command to start development.

---

# Project Goal

Optimize for long-term maintainability rather than rapid feature delivery.
